# Internationalisation support for CASUS

# The WAVES Project

The WAVES project combines skill sets of both academic and enterprise partners to make Scenario-based learning (SBL) more accessible for a wide range of professions.  SBL techniques are widely recognised as a key tool in the educational toolkit, for safe training in competency and decision-making.

# What's in the box

The [CASUS Learning System](https://www.instruct.eu/en/) has at this moment about 2.400 labels and text blocks per language. In the past CASUS focused on
<ul>
	<li>English and</li>
	<li>German</li>
</ul>

As part of WAVES project the following languages were added
<ul>
	<li>Polish</li>
</ul>

We classified the languages in the following way
<ul>
	<li>Core languages, which are maintained by the CASUS team</li>
	<li>Additional languages maintained with support from partners</li>
</ul>

The language specific resources are JAVA property files that consist of key and value pairs; the key is a defined label used in the internationalized templates, the value is the actual translation. Direct work on these property files is possible but not really useful for non-technical persons. The objective of this task was to experiment with a tool, providing a easy to use interface to translate such JAVA property files.
